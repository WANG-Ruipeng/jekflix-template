My fascination with gaming began in primary school, sparked by afternoons spent with my friends in the world of Minecraft.
I immersed in the simple joys of exploration and creation. It wasn't just a game; it was a canvas for our imaginations. 
This early experience sowed the seeds of curiosity: How are these captivating games crafted and designed?

In high school, I began my journey into game design. 
Guided by passion and eagerness to learn, I made quick progress. 
Culminating in the creation of a board game that became a hit. 

The defining moment came during a playtest session. A heartwarming scene unfolded before me: a diverse group - a mother with her child, a high school student, and a man in his 50s - united by my game.
Their laughter and lively discussions over thier shared experiences illuminated the true essence of gaming for me.
Games are more than entertainment; they are bridges, connecting people across different background.

This realization was critial. It mirrored the joy I found in Minecraft and fueled my ambition to create games that foster genuine human connections.
I dreamed of crafting more experiences that, like my board game, brought people together in laughter.

With this newfound purpose, I started on my academic journey at Shenzhen University, deliberately choosing Computer Science with a focus on game design and development.
And at my senior year, I seized the opportunity to study at the University of Pennsylvania, renowned for its exemplary game programming courses.

This journey from Minecraft to my studies in game development captures my passion.
I strive to create games that do more than entertain-they unite, inspire, and bring joy, bridging hearts and generations.
